## Description
This is a simple restaurant order system built using React. The project integrates several modern web technologies including React Router for navigation, Redux for state management, SCSS for styling, and Material UI for the user interface components. The app pulls data from TheMealDB API for meal categories and their respective meal details.

The site is designed with mobile-first principles and is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
